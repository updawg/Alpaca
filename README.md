## Alpaca 2.1.1 | 1.13d
##### By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
##### Released on Friday, November 9, 2018

## Synopsis

Alpaca is an Infinite Stash Mod for Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
that is based off Yohann Nicolas' PlugY 11.02. It is a cleaned up,
re-architected, and stabilized version of PlugY.

Alpaca is a 1.13d modification and will not be upgraded to 1.14d+ due to the
massive code differences and required time investment. However, the codebase
is in a pretty good state and will be an excellent base for someone who does
want to port it over.

Finally, Alpaca IS compatible with my [Diablo II Version Switcher: Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus).
If you want to use Alpaca for your 1.13d install (but also want to continue to play
other mods, versions, etc), you can use Cactus. When using Alpaca with Cactus,
Simply point your Cactus Platform to the "Alpaca.exe" when launching. Cactus also
automatically isolates your character save files and their stashes as well
(Including the Alpaca Stashes).

## Requirements

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable (x86, x64)

## License

All code is licensed under the GPLv3+ since that was the license that Yohann released PlugY 11.02 under.

## Known Bugs

### Picked up item will be lost during character load (If stash contains an item)

If you have items in your stash, and then you pick up an item (and don't place it anywhere),
and save and exit, when you load the game it will be lost. This is an existing PlugY bug that
I wasn't able to fix. I spent a few hours looking around but it will take a way deeper
dive in order to resolve.

### Forwarding characters from previous versions of Diablo II (1.09b -> 1.13d)

If you get a "Unable to enter game. Bad generic file." when entering a game, it means
that you were trying to forward either a character from a previous version of the game
(Such as 1.09b), or a shared stash that was from a previous version, into this current version.
This is not supported. Even if you forward the character with Vanilla D2 (and are able to
play the char with Vanilla D2), the char will not open with this mod. Patches are welcomed
if you really want to support this. An empty character does forward, but I think there is something
going on with the items that character has since normally the normal code will migrate those items
forward (especially 1.09 -> 1.10+).
